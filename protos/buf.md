# STRM Privacy APIs

This module contains all APIs that STRM Privacy exposes.

## Buf Studio

Using Buf Studio is supported, but make sure to add the following in the `Headers`
section:
`Authorization`: `Bearer <your_token>`

A token can be retrieved using `strm auth print-access-token`.

We're looking into ways to improve this.
