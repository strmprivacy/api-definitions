# Because v1 of buf.gen.yaml does not allow to specify an include imports during codegen.
# This means that for each plugin you want to enable this for (it's a buf generate flag)
# a separate file needs to be made in order to specify the flag only for those plugins that
# require it. Issue in buf GitHub: https://github.com/bufbuild/buf/issues/1407
